# WhatsappUI

# Problem Statement -
WhatsApp is the most popular messaging across the world with more than a billion
active users. - https://www.whatsapp.com/ . It is available as a mobile application and as
well as a web application at https://web.whatsapp.com/
Using Bootstrap skills that you have learnt in this level, you are required to create a
fully responsive design of WhatsApp . You are supposed to get the basic layout idea
from the mobile application and the web application. You are free to change the
theme colors, icons, message features etc.
You submission should have following pages -
1) A main page displaying all the chat messages.
2) A chat view page containing messages with an individual or a group
3) A view to change the profile picture.
4) Another main page view which displays all the chat messages but contains some
unread messages from some people.
